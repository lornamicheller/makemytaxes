        <h1>Tax Levi</h1>
        <p>Levies can really do a lot of damage & even ruin your life. A levy is the IRS's way of getting your
          immediate attention. What they are saying is, we have tried to communicate with you but you have ignored us.
          Levies are used to seize your wages & whatever other assets you have. If you own it, they can take it. That
          includes checking accounts, autos, stocks, bonds, boats, paychecks, & even Social Security checks!</p>

      <div class="tax-debt-relief">
        <h1>Tax Debt Relief</h1>
        <p>The IRS views not paying payroll taxes as the cardinal sin of tax delinquency because a large part of the
          payroll taxes are your employees' withholdings. Not paying your company's payroll taxes is tantamount to
          stealing your employees' money in the eyes of the IRS.
          </br>
          </br>
          As a result, penalties for failing to pay your payroll taxes & filing your payroll tax returns on right time
          are much more severe than other types of penalties. They can drastically multiply the amount you owe in a
          very short time.</p>
